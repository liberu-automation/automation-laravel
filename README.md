4. Run the following command:

```bash
./setup.sh
```

and everything should be installed automatically if you are using Linux you just run the script as you normally run scripts in the terminal.

NOTE 1: The script will ask you if you want to have your .env be overwritten by .env.example, in case you have already an .env configuration available please answer with "n" (No).

NOTE 2: This script will run seeders, please make sure you are aware of this and don't run this script if you don't want this to happen.
```bash
composer install
php artisan key:generate
php artisan migrate --seed
```
This will install the necessary dependencies, generate an application key, and set up your database with initial data.

NOTE 3: Ensure your `.env` file is correctly configured with your database connection details before running migrations.

## Building with Docker

1. Ensure you have Docker installed on your system.
2. Open a terminal in the project folder.
3. Run the following command to build the Docker image:
   ```
   docker build -t automation-laravel .
   ```
4. Once the image is built, you can run the container with:
   ```
   docker run -p 8000:8000 automation-laravel
   ```

NOTE 3: Ensure your `.env` file is correctly configured with your database connection details before running migrations.

### Using Laravel Sail

This project also includes support for Laravel Sail, which provides a Docker-based development environment. To use Laravel Sail, follow these steps:

2. Open a terminal in the project folder.
3. Run the following command to start the Laravel Sail environment:
   ```
   ./vendor/bin/sail up
   ```
4. Once the containers are running, you can access the application at `http://localhost`.
5. To stop the Sail environment, press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal.

For more information on using Laravel Sail, refer to the [official documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/sail).
